"# University-Dissertation"

The overall goal of this project is to design, develop and implement a high quality mobile application based on the Android platform, that delivers an innovative new way of concept on how users record and view expenditures for the purposes of a budget managing application that incorporates AI features. The application built is a native Android application that uses XML and JAVA language and incorporates third party libraries such as retrofit and Picasso to aid in the production of the application.
User testing has been carried out on a number of different devices to test the XML layout in addition Backbox testing has also been carried out to test the functionality of the produced application. 
By producing an investigative approach in the analysis section and requirements section this will influence on how my synthesis is to be structured and what design and development functions I have considered throughout the project.
Overall this produces a completed project that has been researched, thoroughly designed, developed and tested to create a working prototype application.
To conclude, an evaluation of the project process and product has been discussed to conclude what has been done well and what needs improving.


Extracting Mobile Application
*Note:  If extraction fails it is probably due to very long naming directories
	therefore extract it to a location such as the C drive or Desktop

Mobile Application APK File
*Note: this is an unsigned APK file so if you can't install the APK on your device you must allow it in the device settings.
1)Copy the apk app-debug.apk to SD card.
2Download app called "ES File Explorer" from Android Market.
3)On opening the app browse to where you saved the APK 
4)Click on the app, and it gets installed.

The application can be installed and it will run without needing any other setup. Server files are hosted 
on the web but identical files are also provided in the Server Files Folder (containing PHP scripts and Image Files)

Once you have installed the application create an account by going to register screen, register, go to login screen and login.
You will then be logged in and you can use the application.

Important Note:
The application only works with the intended hosted server, if the server details are changed
the URL will also have to be changed in the application.
